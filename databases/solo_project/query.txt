Queries

--Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
select department, name from employee;

--Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that --makes sense).
update timecard set description="Description for project PJ04" where projectnum="PJ04";

--Display the information in both tables using one query.
select * from employee emp, timecard t where emp.id = t.employeeid ;

--Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in --other words) from both tables using one query.

select emp.department,  emp.name, t.projectnum, t.timedate, t.hours from employee emp, timecard t where emp.id = t.employeeid order by emp.department;

--Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

delete from timecard where projectnum = "PJ02"

--Try a few different joins in your database, and record the commands
-- CROSS JOINS
select name, department, hours from employee cross join timecard;
